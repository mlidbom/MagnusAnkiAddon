# dev_docs

Folder where we should place .md files about:

- **Code review findings** — issues, bugs, and design concerns discovered during reviews
- **Progress tracking** — status documents for major features and refactoring efforts
- **Architecture notes** — current-state analysis and design decisions under consideration

These documents capture the current state of the codebase and ongoing work. They are living documents meant to be updated or removed as issues are resolved and work progresses.
