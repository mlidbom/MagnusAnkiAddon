## Syncing

This directory is synced with https://github.com/mlidbom/copilot-code-standards-and-instructions via simple clone-and-copy scripts in `sync-scripts/`.

- **Pull** updates from remote: `.\sync-scripts\pull-shared-instructions.ps1`
- **Push** local changes to remote: `.\sync-scripts\push-shared-instructions.ps1`

The sync-scripts are themselves part of the shared repo, so every consumer gets them automatically.
