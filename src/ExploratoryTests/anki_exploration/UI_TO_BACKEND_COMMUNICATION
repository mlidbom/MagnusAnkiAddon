# gui_hooks.webview_did_receive_js_message() allows you to intercept messages
# sent from Javascript. Anki provides a pycmd(string) function in Javascript which sends
# a message back to Python, and various screens such as reviewer.py respond to the messages.
# By using this hook, you can respond to your own messages as well.
