#top contenders:
#UniDic2UD https://github.com/KoichiYasuoka/UniDic2UD Seems to do everything I want and quite well. Using universal dependencies is a boon too. Documentation and standardization.

#alternatives:
# spacy https://spacy.io/
# ginza https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza
#
# SuPar-UniDic https://github.com/KoichiYasuoka/SuPar-UniDic
# cabocha http://taku910.github.io/cabocha/ Yet Another Japanese Dependency Structure Analyzer
#
# seem to require external tools installation
# juman++ https://pyknp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

#Janome, fast, but no mapping to the kanji representations so that one can find the correct words.
#Sudachi, TODO

#Probably not
#Java, with bindings..
#Kuromoji https://www.atilika.org/


#Tested and Probably Not
#Ginza, A metric ton of dependencies that will likely be hell to try and package for multiple platforms
#unidic-combo 1.4.1 https://pypi.org/project/unidic-combo/
#A ton of dependencies, start-up takes forever and even after that it is quite slow. As slow as, or slower than, UniDic2UD
#
#Mecab: Outputs only text and does not seem to have dependency analysis.
