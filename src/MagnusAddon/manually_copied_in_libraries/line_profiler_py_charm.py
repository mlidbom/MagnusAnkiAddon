    When the process exits, the profile results are written to a `.pclprof` file, which contains json data.

    The PyCharm Line Profiler plugin can visualize the json file with neat colormaps and other stuff
    directly into the code in the editors.

    PyCharmLineProfiler uses an environment variable called
        PC_LINE_PROFILER_STATS_FILENAME
    to determine where to save the profile file. This environment variable is set by the Line Profiler plugin
    so that plugin's Executor extension can automatically open the results of a profiling after running it.
